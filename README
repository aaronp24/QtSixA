QtSixA is the Sixaxis Joystick Manager
 ------------------------------------

QtSixA can connect PS3 hardware (Sixaxis/DualShock3 and Keypads)
to a Linux-compatible machine.

"QtSixA" is the GUI (interface), while "sixad" is the backend C++ code.

Currently sixad supports:
 - Sixaxis buttons, axis, accelerometers, leds and rumble
 - PS3 Keypads

sixad also registers the Sixaxis and Keypad's MAC/ID in the joystick name
(ex: "PLAYSTATION(R)3 Controller (00:XX:X0:0X:XX)".

sixad is triggered by udev, making it super easy to connect new devices
(you just need to press the PS button)

The Changelog is "debian/changelog" (the older one in "qtsixa/doc/changelog.old" has been deleted)

 -------------------------------------

QtSixA and sixad are licensed under the GNU GPL v2 license.
