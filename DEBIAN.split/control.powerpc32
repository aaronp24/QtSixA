Description: sixad - SixA Daemon
 This package provides the modules (called 'sixad') for connecting PS3 hardware (Sixaxis/DualShock3 and Keypads) to a Linux-compatible machine (through bluetooth or hidraw).
 sixad supports Sixaxis' buttons, axis, accelerometers, acceleration/speed/position, and LEDs. The rumble feature is experimental.
 sixad also registers the Sixaxis and Keypad's MAC/ID in the joystick name (ex: "PLAYSTATION(R)3 Controller (00:XX:X0:0X:XX)".
 .
 sixad is triggered by udev, so pressing the PS button is enough to connect the devices.
