README for sixad, just to clarify a few things

When a user presses the PS button on the Sixaxis (and if it is paired correctly to the PC),
the "normal" bluetooth detects it and asks the user for permission to connect to it.
Since BlueZ doesn't support Sixaxis (or any other joystick?), here sixad takes action.

sixad has a udev rule that consists on:
 - When a new bluetooth device is found, (among other stuff) run:
	  hcitool name `hcitool con | head -n 2 | tail -n 1 | awk '{printf$3}'` | grep -e 'PLAYSTATION(R)3 Controller' -e 'Wireless Keypad'
    (0) If anything gets printed -> Just don't do anything
    (1) If something gets printed -> then we got a new Sixaxis or Keypad:
	- Then "sixad --udev" is runned, which will:
	    1 路 Stop "normal" bluetooth
	    2 路 Start sixad (if not already running)
	    3 路 Start hcid, hold 10 seconds, then stop it
	    4 路 Restore "normal" bluetooth

When "sixad --start" is run from a terminal, hcid will run forever until stopped.
Same thing is for "sixad --force".
