-- TODO Stuff before sixad v1.0:

 - Rumble support for DualShock3:  -- In progress
  · Needs check if device is Sixaxis or DualShock3 (?) [not sure if needed]
  · I don't have a DualShock3 yet, ask for testing volunteers
  · Get a DualShock3 and finish code
 - Fix PowerPC-32 UInput error:
  · Try to use patch from WiiMote guys
  · Needs too many checking, ask for testing volunteers


Stuff to do later:
 - Wake up a PC from suspend
 - RPM repo ? -> needs some study
 - Make Ubuntu repository trusted - Need help!
 - What else ?
 -
